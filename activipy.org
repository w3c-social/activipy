Python is an imperative language; we won't try to be "purely
functional" but "hidden state" could really screw us, so we'll try to
reduce that as much as possible.

We need:
 - Use a gdbm backed activitystreams object storage
 - For extensions, pyld
 - verifiers
 - method dispatch

DMD store should store in a dictionary like:
... with the key being the "@id" of the toplevel activitystreams
object.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  {"asobj": {"@type": "Object",
             "@id": "uuid:d773cb99-078b-496b-b3f0-012d3ade5930",
             "blah": "blah"},
   "private": {"blah": "blah"}}
#+END_SRC

We are going to have to handle inheritance manually, because there can
be multiple types.  We can't use python's inheritance system.

We need an "ASVocab" system to operate within.  This one should have
a memoized version of the json-ld expansion of the default
activitystreams vocabulary, but it should also have a mapping of
type URIs to ASClass objects.

The store will be used separately, should provide simple store and
retrieve mechanisms.

Some complexity comes from the fact that in a "real world" system, we
don't just store and receive what's been given to us.  We need a way
to trigger application-specific hooks.

* Tasks
** TODO Handle all @context edges
*** Brainstorming

Probably what we ought to do is enforce that everything in an ASObj
share a common @context setup.

This means, it doesn't matter what's on an @context coming into
ASObj(), we slice it off and replace it with @context after the
deepcopy_in (and all child objects, we don't need an @context at all).

But we do need to be able to "ingest foreign material", which means we
should provide an Environment.ingest() method (or .ingest_foreign())

*** TODO Handling when creating new ASObj()

Basically, strip off the existing @context recursively with
deepcopy_in, and add our context instead, if any exists.

*** TODO Environment.ingest(jsonld, imply_asvocab=True)

This should expand out a json-ld document then compact it to the
Environment's own context.

The question is, can we use the "grafted-on @context" required in the
above description, or do we have

*** TODO breaking off a child ASObj

Basically attach an @context to the json we have of it (though I guess
this will happen automatically)

** TODO Switch from method "object symbols" to strings?

Currently we require setting up "object symbols" which self-document
what a method does and etc, but they're also slightly unwieldy to set
up.  It will be less precise, but maybe easier, to just use strings to
represent what a method is.

** TODO Add memoization
*** TODO General memoization function
*** TODO Property memoization
** TODO Switch ASObj.__getitem__ to use deepcopy_jsobj_out

Or rather, we should specify both a deepcopy_jsobj_in and a deepcopy_jsobj_out :)

So, if we're accessing a key value pair where the value is a list of
activitystreams objects, we'd like the activitystreams objects
converted to ASObj objects as well.

*** TODO Add deepcopy_jsobj_out
*** TODO Use it in ASObj.__getitem__
*** TODO Rename deepcopy_jsobj -> deepcopy_jsobj_in

** TODO Add ASProp

** TODO Add demos section
*** TODO linter/validator

We can use the method dispatch system to handle this.

ActivityStreams objects can have multiple "@type" fields.

**** Relevant parts of convo

<evanpro> paroneayea: so, a couple of questions on that
<evanpro> Does having a single package that is a producer and a consumer make
          sense? Or multiple packages?                                  [12:18]
<paroneayea> evanpro: my first goal is to make a library for the purpose of
             tests, basically along the lines of how you suggested... it'll
             just store @id's to a gdbm store.  But I'll design it in a way
             that afterwards, it can be used for something like pypump, and
             for using as2 stuff
<paroneayea> but my first goal is: fulfill the test requirements
<evanpro> Whoa!
<paroneayea> while working towards something more general
<paroneayea> gdbm is oldschool I know
<evanpro> Wait what's the GDBM for?
<evanpro> I don't understand what you need persistence for              [12:19]
<paroneayea> well it could also just be a dictionary
<evanpro> Wouldn't an AS2 library do something like
<paroneayea> I was going along with your suggestion that you have a
             command-line submission tool
<evanpro> JSON -> native language object
<evanpro> and native language object -> JSON
<paroneayea> evanpro: yes
<paroneayea> evanpro: ok well maybe it can be in-memory only            [12:20]
<paroneayea> evanpro: my main concern is get the thing working
<evanpro> 1s
<evanpro> So I was thinking that a test command-line app might look like this
<evanpro> https://gist.github.com/evanp/b49c3fc37caa21a323a1
<strugee> hey, would it be useful if I created next week's meeting page and
          filled it with the stuff on the agenda that we didn't get to?
<strugee> e.g. we missed branching models
<evanpro> strugee: YES!                                                 [12:23]
<evanpro> Nice
<paroneayea> evanpro: that might work nicely
<strugee> will do
<paroneayea> evanpro: okay, I will probably do something like that      [12:24]
<evanpro> paroneayea: and then a test driver would work like this
<evanpro> https://gist.github.com/evanp/5d80c0aa3f168465d84d
<evanpro> So that way you could call "testdriver.py dumpactivitytype.py"
                                                                        [12:25]
<evanpro> as well as "testdriver.py dumpactivitytype.rb"
<paroneayea> evanpro: ok
<paroneayea> evanpro: I see
<paroneayea> evanpro: we also want a way to show mutations              [12:26]
<paroneayea> evanpro: and side effects
<paroneayea> eg update verbs should actually update the thing in store
<evanpro> That might be too much for a data format to deal with
<paroneayea> evanpro: I mean, for the test suite
<evanpro> Yes, that's what I'm saying
<paroneayea> we want to be sure that activities can actually do the things
             they promise
<evanpro> What I'm saying is that no we don't                           [12:27]
<evanpro> When we're testing the social API, definitely
<paroneayea> evanpro: this is why I was saying that there's not much to do as
             in terms of a test suite
<evanpro> But I think an activity streams library should just parse from JSON
          and export to JSON
<paroneayea> the only thing your example checks really is that it's valid
             right?
<paroneayea> that it's json, has the right fields, in the right types
<evanpro> It checks that the activitystreams implementation library (the one
          that the dumpactivitytype.py script imports) can find the type of an
          activity                                                      [12:28]
<evanpro> I realize that it appears to be really trivial
<evanpro> But you'd need dozens of such test scripts                    [12:29]
<evanpro> dumpactivityactortype.py
<evanpro> dumpactivityactorid.py
<evanpro> That kind of thing
<paroneayea> evanpro: okay, so I'll definitely support this.
<evanpro> Another possibility is using command-line arguments
<paroneayea> evanpro: though, one of the things is, the activitystreams
             vocabulary *does* describe things with side effects
<paroneayea> I might test for that too, but I won't make it so complex that
             you can't do the simple tsts you ahve                      [12:30]
<evanpro> That's probably a fair point
<evanpro> I would really, really strongly recommend that you first publish
          your intentions for the test format
<paroneayea> evanpro: to the list?
<evanpro> And that you concentrate on the bare minimum first
<evanpro> Yes
<paroneayea> evanpro: okay I'll do that
<evanpro> to the list                                                   [12:31]
<paroneayea> evanpro: I was planning on working on deployment stuff this week,
             but it seems like this has become really urgent
<paroneayea> so I'll make it priority #1
<evanpro> So, one thing we can do when we have even a rudimentary test suite
<evanpro> Is that we can start testing libraries
<evanpro> And so we can start writing libraries                         [12:32]
<paroneayea> evanpro: right
<evanpro> We could even have a hackathon to implement in a lot of different
          languages
<evanpro> And push implementations to npm, Ruby gems, pypi, etc.
<paroneayea> evanpro: anyway, maybe now you can see why I was looking at gdbm;
             if we do have a command line test thing and we *do* promise to
             deliver tests on side effects
<paroneayea> we need some way to persist things
<paroneayea> but
<paroneayea> I agree
<paroneayea> there are tests that don't need that
<evanpro> Right, I hear you
<paroneayea> focus on the other stuff first.
<evanpro> They seem trivial but they are so important                   [12:33]
<evanpro> Probably the big thing is defining what the interface between
          testdriver script and the tested script is
<paroneayea> (and the reason why gdbm is even though it's oldschool, it's also
             dead easy to get working because it's so "dumb")
<paroneayea> evanpro: right.
<evanpro> Oh, yeah, GDBM is fine there
<evanpro> I might suggest using command-line args, too                  [12:34]
<paroneayea> evanpro: I get why you had a "don't engineer this, chris!"
             reaction though :)
<evanpro> maybe something like this
<paroneayea> er
<paroneayea> overengineer
<evanpro> <dumpscript> --activity-part actor --part-property id <filename>
<evanpro> <dumpscript> --activity-part=actor --part-property=id <filename>
                                                                        [12:35]
<evanpro> Those are crummy names but :shrug:
<evanpro> That way implementers don't have to write 50 different testing shims
<paroneayea> evanpro: I hear you
<paroneayea> evanpro: well, it may even be easier                       [12:36]
<evanpro> It may also be worthwhile to have a producer test
<paroneayea> --extract ["actor"]["@id"]
<evanpro> That takes in some parameters and outputs some JSON
<evanpro> Sure
<evanpro> I'd be a little worried about defining a query language
<evanpro> But yeah
<paroneayea> evanpro: it's probably equally complex to define a billion
             arguments
<evanpro> So a producer script might take arguments like this
<paroneayea> for the different components                               [12:37]
<evanpro> agreed!
<evanpro> <buildscript> --actor-id=urn:test:whatever --actor-name="Evan
          Prodromou" --activity-type="Like" --object-id=urn:test:whatever2
          --object-name="This terrible test"                            [12:38]
<evanpro> But yeah pretty nightmarish
<paroneayea> evanpro: so is the idea that this should spit out a
             success/failure code or
<evanpro> Oh, no!
<evanpro> It should spit out JSON!
<paroneayea> just extract the right part?
<paroneayea> okay
<paroneayea> evanpro: and it should validate, right?                    [12:39]
<evanpro> dumpscript == take JSON, just spit out some extracted part of it
<evanpro> buildscript = take params, spit out JSON
<paroneayea> oh I see.
<paroneayea> okay that makes much more sense.
<paroneayea> echoscript == take json, dump out json
<paroneayea> sorry ;)
<evanpro> dumpscript and buildscript are provided by the implementer to test
          the implementation                                            [12:40]
<evanpro> and there's a test driver to run them
<evanpro> so "testdriver dumpscript.py buildscript.py"
<evanpro> Would run all the tests
<evanpro> Or something like that
<paroneayea> hm ok....
<paroneayea> evanpro: I don't understand testdriver                     [12:41]

**** Brainstorm

Okay, so what do we want to do here?

 - Vocabularies might provide an "implied context".  That's the
   biggest issue, because otherwise it can be inferred unambiguously
   from expanding the document.
 - Mostly, we might not want to re-read things?

This last one is a good goal but maybe we shouldn't worry about it
immediately.

Here's the options from the JsonLdProcessor code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  class JsonLdProcessor(object):
      """
      A JSON-LD processor.
      """
      # [...]
      def expand(self, input_, options):
          """
          Performs JSON-LD expansion.

          :param input_: the JSON-LD input to expand.
          :param options: the options to use.
            [base] the base IRI to use.
            [expandContext] a context to expand with.
            [keepFreeFloatingNodes] True to keep free-floating nodes,
              False not to (default: False).
            [documentLoader(url)] the document loader
              (default: _default_document_loader).

          :return: the expanded JSON-LD output.
          """
#+END_SRC

 - we probably want to be able to set expandContext.
 - the documentLoader could thus possibly come with some context
   preloaded.  But that's kind of an optimization.
   
At least we know the two main steps now?

*Update:* It turns out the first of these is much simpler than we
originally were thinking!  There's only one implied context in
ActivityStreams, so we can hardcode the expandContext.

We should do this like in the ANSI Common Lisp book, where we remove
duplicates, but we remove duplictes but keep the *last* appearance of
a "class"

This is trickier than one may think; we can't do Python style 
method resolution because an activity may have multiple types.

Something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from activipy import vocab

  root_beer_note = vocab.Create(
      actor=vocab.Person(
          "http://tsyesika.co.uk",
          displayName="Jessica Tallon"),
      to=["acct:cwebber@identi.ca"],
      object=vocab.Note(
          "http://tsyesika.co.uk/chat/sup-yo/",
          content="Up for some root beer floats?"))
#+END_SRC

This should be able to flow pretty naturally out of our types.py
interface.

**** Brainstorm

So here's how this thing works.

There's an environment, which has a mapping between tuples of
(method_symbol, Vocab) and method_to_call.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  #                    method name    description    invocation method
  save = Method("save", "Save things", handle_one)
  gather_something = Method("gather_something", "Accrues some info", handle_map)

  myenv = Enviroment(
     mapping={
         (save, Note): note_save,
         (save, Object): basic_save,
  })

  handle_one(myobj, save, db)
#+END_SRC

This way, using the inheritance_chain() method, we can handle
various types of method handling:

 - handle_one
 - handle_map
 - handle_fold

However, we have enough metadata here to provide some sugar.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  myenv = Environment(
    mapping={bla bla},
    vocab=vocab)

  activity = Environment.c.Activity("http://oh/snap")
  activity.m.save(db)
  # or maybe even just activity.save()
#+END_SRC

This would have to mean that ASObj gets a method dispatch keyword
option on construction, which might be a-ok.

I think this is a pretty good approach.

**** Brainstorm

Here's the problem.

Assume we made an activity like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
ROOT_BEER_NOTE_VOCAB = vocab.Create(
    "http://tsyesika.co.uk/act/foo-id-here/",
    actor=vocab.Person(
        "http://tsyesika.co.uk/",
        displayName="Jessica Tallon"),
    to=["acct:cwebber@identi.ca",
        "acct:justaguy@rhiaro.co.uk"],
    object=vocab.Note(
        "htp://tsyesika.co.uk/chat/sup-yo/",
        content="Up for some root beer floats?"))
#+END_SRC

Now assume we made one like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
ROOT_BEER_NOTE_JSOBJ = types.ASObj({
    "@type": "Create",
    "@id": "http://tsyesika.co.uk/act/foo-id-here/",
    "actor": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "@id": "http://tsyesika.co.uk/",
        "displayName": "Jessica Tallon"},
    "to": ["acct:cwebber@identi.ca",
           "acct:justaguy@rhiaro.co.uk"],
    "object": {
        "@type": "Note",
        "@id": "htp://tsyesika.co.uk/chat/sup-yo/",
        "content": "Up for some root beer floats?"}})
#+END_SRC

Now even worse:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  ROOT_BEER_NOTE_JSOBJ = types.ASObj({
      # AAAAAAAAAAA
      "@type": "http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Create", 
      "@id": "http://tsyesika.co.uk/act/foo-id-here/",
      "actor": {
          "@type": "Person",
          "@id": "http://tsyesika.co.uk/",
          "displayName": "Jessica Tallon"},
      "to": ["acct:cwebber@identi.ca",
             "acct:justaguy@rhiaro.co.uk"],
      "object": {
          "@type": "Note",
          "@id": "htp://tsyesika.co.uk/chat/sup-yo/",
          "content": "Up for some root beer floats?"}})
#+END_SRC

So...
 - we really need to know about the whole set of vocabularies in order
   to do ASObj.type_astype()
 - Obviously, we also need to for method dispatch also
 - It could be then that we don't load ASObj.vocab, but ASObj.env
 - Also, in general you can always do env.asobj_astypes(asobj)
 - Thus, we should also provide env.asobj_method(asobj, method_symbol)
 - Which means also, more obviously, and as a precedent, we must
   provide Environment.asobj_astype_chain(asobj)!

This also means that users should, in general, not use
ASObj.type_astype(), unless they're using the "sugar" edition
which comes from supplying an environment.

We might want to also provide an expanded=True argument to some of those methods.

OR, maybe we can do "cheapest available" determination of an ASType.

What are the ways we might go about pulling down an ASType?

 - By short ID... but this requires this short ID be marked "safe"
   for short expansion
 - By already known URI
 - By json-ld examination (most expensive!)

Do we really want an expand=None?  Maybe that's kind of dumb

**** DONE From short id
    CLOSED: [2015-10-28 Wed 17:17]

The question is, where do we mark whether its safe to consider the
short_id as a safe representation from?  Is it in the environment
or in the vocab?

The vocab may make sense because we could do a
shortids=load_from_vocabs((Vocab1, None), (GMGVocab, "gmg:"))
