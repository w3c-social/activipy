#+TITLE: Activipy: ActivityStreams 2.0 stuff for Python

Read the [[http://activipy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html][documentation!]]

* What is this?

Activipy is an implementation of ActivityStreams 2.0 for Python.

It also, hopefully soon, will serve as an ActivityStreams validator.

More things will go here in the future, in the meanwhile maybe see
[[file:./activipy.org][activipy.org]] in this directory for braindumps and tasks.
